# A description of the web application
This application allows users to create their own projects in their own gallery which will be non-collaborative. If a user wants to create a collaborative project, then they must create it in their shared gallery where they can invite users to collaborate on a single canvas and each user will be able to simultaneously modify one single canvas. This will act as a tool to support several activities such as creating collaborative art, brainstorming with teammates, teaching, etc. The web application will include a chat system on the side to allow users to communicate with one another through text so they are not only restricted to collaborating on a canvas. This application will also offer users a variety of utensils to draw with.

# A description of the key features that will be completed by the Beta version

Feature 1: User profiles - Non-authenticated users can sign up to the app, authenticated users can sign in/out the app. Authenticated users can view their profile.

Feature 2: Canvas - This will be the main part of the application, users will be able to draw on the same canvas simultaneously (if the owner allows for collaboration). Users will be able to change the colour of their strokes.

Feature 3: Usersâ€™ galleries and shared galleries - there will be two galleries for each user. One is the user's own gallery where users can browse their own non-shared projects and the second is the shared gallery where users can browse projects shared to them.

Feature 4: Collaboration - Users will be able to work on the same shared project simultaneously.

# A description of the additional features that will be complete by the Final version

Feature 1: Chat system - This will allow users to communicate with one another through text.

Feature 2: Utensil Selection - Users will be able to choose any utensil of their liking. Example: Can change strokes to paint brush strokes or pencil strokes.

# A description of the technology stack that you will use to build and deploy it

Frontend: React.js Bootstrap

Backend: express.js

Database: GraphQL

Package Manager: npm - Node Package Manager

# A description of the top 5 technical challenges

1. The ability to make the application collaborative, connecting users into one collaborative project. Sockets may be used. (Potential library socket.io)
3. Implementing different paint strokes, brush, pencil, spray paint, etc.
5. We never used GraphQL before, so there will be technical challenges to get familiarized and mastered with this database.
6. Even though our team used React.js before, it has been a while since we last touched it. Therefore, we will need to conquer any potential frontend technical difficulties.
7. Properly connecting users and allowing them to send messages in real-time.
